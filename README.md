# speedrun-bot
Simple discord bot to record speedruns for a game. I wrote it in a rush, hence horrible looking unrefactored code.

    !speedrun add [time]

and to retrieve current top runs:

    !speedrun

## Future plans?

I only did this as a quick project, but immediately started to think about
what else this would need if it was to be useful to others.  (Don't worry, if I do, I'll fix up the code to make it nicely structured and clean)

- Ability to add different games.
- Ability to add different speed run categories to games.
- Ability for others to add times on behalf of a user (via permissions).
- Ability to set a limit and only store the top X times for a user.
- Ability to add it to other servers - Currently only built to work on one server.
- Ability to maintain daily, weekly, monthly, all time runs.
